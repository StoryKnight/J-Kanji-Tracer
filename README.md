# J-Kanji-Tracer
A functional dictionary for Japanese Kanji and definitions. Offers tracing capability.

Use the "vocab.txt" file to create a running list of all the Kanji / vocabulary that you wish to add.
Vocabulary is parsed in "Key:Value" pairs when the project is ran.

The hashmap is custom-made and all of it is encoded to UTF-8.

Currently there is no executable file.
