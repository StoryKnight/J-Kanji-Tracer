Kanji / Vocab Dictionary

- has UI
- uses an underlying hashmap (with a linked list)
- UTF-8 for characters
- Loads "full-size" kanji characters to trace
- (this ends up being whatever you want, technically
        so long as it can be drawn under UTF-8)


CURRENT ISSUES:
    - hash function OR getVal function is flawed
    - some queries for keys return null when they shouldn't



PARTS TO IMPLEMENT IN ORDER:

        UNDERLYING DICTIONARY (X)
- Make sure the encoding put() works with UTF-8
- Test out some characters in command line
- Figure out a way to statically hold the kanji and vocabulary (which uses
                                    a separate hashmap)

        SET UP A QUERY BASE
- use a text file
- use the display() method to insert it into a file
- overwrites the last one
- allows values to be queried

        METHOD TO DISPLAY THE KANJI
- Displays Kanji (key) in large fashion in the center
- in lower font, shows the definition and uses (value)

        DRAWABLE
- Enables Kanji to "drawn over"
- Enables marks to be erased

        LEARN FEATURES
- menu allows searching modes
    - specifically for key, value pairs
    - can be RANDOMLY displayed as well
